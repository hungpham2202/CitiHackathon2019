# CitiHackathon2019

This is the result of 20 people working together for about 16 hours (Though it has not finished yet - the front-end and back-end has not yet fully integrated).
Anyway, it has ended, so the repository is still marked as archived.

This Web App is made for volunteer event organizer & participants to manage their events, containing 4 main parts:
- EventHandler: handles event such as view, create new events, v..v - the main functionality of the app.
- Communicator: communicates between the app and third party such as sending email notification.
- Authenticator: stores login information for admin and users.
- Reporter: generates reports for events as well as user profiles.
